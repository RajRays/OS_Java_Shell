Operating Systems Course Project: Creating A Shell Interface Using Java
* Using ProcessBuilder Class to create external process to run commands

________________________________________________________________________

Part 1
* Implement SimpleShell
* Use ProcessBuilder Class To Create External Processes


Part 2
* Implement "cd" Command -> Change Directory
* "cd" Command MUST Include...
      * [cd]          -> Change To Home Directory
      * [cd ~]        -> Change To Home Directory
      * [cd .]        -> Stay At Current Directory
      * [cd ..]       -> Ascend One Directory
      * [cd ../../..] -> Ascend Multiple (nth) Directories
      * [cd /]        -> Change To Root Directory 
     
     
Part 3
* Implement History Feature



Extra Commands I Added For Fun
* "ls" -> List All Files And Directories Within Current Directory
* "cp" -> Copy One File To Another. If File Copied Too Does Not Exist, Creates File 
* "cat" -> Reads File To Console
* "cd" -> "cd" Is A Requirement, However I Added The Ability To Change Into Any Valid Directory
